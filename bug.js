This error typically occurs when the Expo CLI cannot locate or access the necessary Android SDK components.  It might be due to incorrect environment variables, missing SDK tools, or problems with the Android SDK installation itself. The error message itself can vary slightly based on the specific issue.  Debugging often involves checking the SDK installation, environment variables, and potentially reinstalling parts of the Android SDK.

Example error message (may vary):
`'ANDROID_HOME' is not set and 'android' command not in your PATH.`
